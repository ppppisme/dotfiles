2018-01-25 10:24:04	erdave	Nope, thats not the one that comes pre-installed with plasma in arch... Now that I see, it uses a software center called "discover". Damn, thats the consecuences of having two months without updating arch, too much changes in a single update xD
2018-01-25 10:24:58	CorePoint	yeah, what i meant is that you could replace it. everything is a widget in plasma anyway right?

2018-01-25 16:41:58	tomeaton17	What is the :8?
2018-01-25 16:41:59	david89	Hello. I am using NetworkManager and the KDE applet. I'm having problems with some passwords not saving, or autoconnect not working. They used to work correctly and I believe that after one of the latest updates something happened. I want to delete all network config and start fresh, any ideas on how to achieve this?
2018-01-25 16:42:22	Lartza	it makes nvidia-settings access X display :8 or something
2018-01-25 16:42:28	Lartza	Which, apparently works
2018-01-25 16:42:35	Lartza	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-01-25 16:42:38	tomeaton17	Yeah. Is not correctly detected my displays however
2018-01-25 16:43:03	Lartza	Does it need to?

2018-01-25 16:45:58	tomeaton17	Lartza: No, system wide. I get really bad screen tearing on chrome especially
2018-01-25 16:46:29	Lartza	That's because chrome doesn't support hardware acceleration probably
2018-01-25 16:46:47	Lartza	Or well, doesn't have it enabled for your GPU for some reason

2018-01-25 16:47:49	Lartza	oh I see you did

2018-01-25 16:48:36	demonicmaniac3	for nvidia and no tearing

2018-01-25 16:49:41	coderobe	tomeaton17: tearing usually depends on your window manager
2018-01-25 16:49:44	Lartza	Although there's no video accel so
2018-01-25 16:49:46	Lartza	:P
2018-01-25 16:49:55	tomeaton17	There is hardware acceleration in chrome
2018-01-25 16:50:02	Lartza	tomeaton17, Not for video
2018-01-25 16:50:02	demonicmaniac3	intel is also accelrated and it's a bloody browser and not a massive 3d game..
2018-01-25 16:50:05	tomeaton17	How do I change intel settings?
2018-01-25 16:50:20	tomeaton17	Its quite taxing on a 4k screen when watching video
2018-01-25 16:50:22	coderobe	ie if your window manager supports epoxy you can use that for opengl-backed vsyncing

2018-01-25 16:51:24	coderobe	Foxboron: hashing files with several algorithms, i find it useful because it provides context menu applets for all major file browsers that let you checksum files easily

2018-01-25 16:51:46	Lartza	tomeaton17, https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/532294 you need chromium-vaapi from AUR
2018-01-25 16:51:48	coderobe	i mean you can do it on the terminal just fine, but i like the usability of the context menu
